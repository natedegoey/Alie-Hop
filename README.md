# Alie-Hop
Assembly Language Project. My own spin on the flash game Doodle Jump. Culminating assignment in my Computer Organization class at the University of Toronto (CSC258H1).
Made using MIPS assembly language in the MARS simulated envrionment. Used with a simulated bitmap display and keyboard input. Use the "j" and "k" keys to move left and right, respectively. While working through the project, I implemented the working game (similar to doodle jump) and continued to personalize the project by adding sound effects, a scoreboard that updates in real time, the ability to enter your name (up to a maximum of 4 letters) before you start the game, the ability to retry, some fancier graphics, and random pop-up messages to encourage the player to keep playing!
I am super proud of this project. This was my first time working in Assembly, and while it was a huge learning curve, I am extremely happy with how my game turned out.
Final Score: 100%
